!!Usage tags

These tags distinguish different special-purpose analysers
and generators from each other. Thus, for examples, we have
normative and descriptive analysers, and generators for different purposes.

 * +Err/Orth  tag for substandard forms
 * +Use/NG   not-generate, for ped generation isme-ped.fst



Flagdiacritics

These are documented in Chapter 8 of Beesley/Karttunen, p. 456 zB.

For indicative, there are prefixes, so here we need one
flag for each person-number combination. Note that
for the inverse objective conjugation, the flag refers to
the __prefix__, not to the subject. So ''indsg1'' refers to either
subject = 1Sg or object = 1Sg. The 3-3 forms are prefixless.

Conjugation classes



Preverbs






The conjunct form always has
the ê- prefix, and future conditional never has a prefix.
