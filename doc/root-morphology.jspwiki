Preverbs






!!Auxiliary symbols

These symbols either shape or govern the
morphophonological structure

 * %> 		  suffix border
 * %< 		  prefix border

Special characters for morphophonology
 * w2       mowêw:mow2
 * t2 		 Epenthetic -t- between person prefixes and vowel-initial stems
 * t3       t to s in VTA-4
 * t4       t:c in VTI-1 with unspecified actor
 * y2       epenthetic joiner in reduplication of vowel-initial stems
 * y3       epenthetic joiner in reduplication of vowel-initial stems
 * i2       vta-5i epenthesis.

 * h2 		  Prefix in possessives


Triggers for various morphophonological phenomena
Mostly, these are not realized themselves as any grapheme/phoneme

 * %^EGLOT    glottal stop after e, for eh- in conjunctive order


!!Usage tags

These tags distinguish different special-purpose analysers
and generators from each other. Thus, for examples, we have
normative and descriptive analysers, and generators for different purposes.

 * +Err/Orth  tag for substandard forms
 * +Use/NG   not-generate, for ped generation isme-ped.fst


Flagdiacritics

These are documented in Chapter 8 of Beesley/Karttunen, p. 456 zB.

For indicative, there are prefixes, so here we need one
flag for each person-number combination. Note that
for the inverse objective conjugation, the flag refers to
the __prefix__, not to the subject. So ''indsg1'' refers to either
subject = 1Sg or object = 1Sg. The 3-3 forms are prefixless.







The conjunct form always has
the ê- prefix, and future conditional never has a prefix.

 * @U.verb.FutCon@  Future Conditional

 * @U.order.cnj@   Conjunct
 * @U.verb.fut@   Future Conditional

Prefixes with a certain phonological content:

 * @U.person.NULL@ 
 * @U.person.NI@ 
 * @U.person.KI@
