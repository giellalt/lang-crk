__Suffix a Deletion in Vowel Final Stems__ gives maskwa + ak = plural maskwak

__w Insertion in Front of Vowel Initial Suffix after ksv c__ inserts w after k in front of plural -ak
Note that this rule probably is wrong, and that the -w- is
a morphological affix rather than a phonological variant.

__Stem Final n __
