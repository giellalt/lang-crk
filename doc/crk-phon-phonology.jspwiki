!!!Rules


__Suffix a Deletion in Vowel Final Stems__ gives maskwa + ak = plural maskwak

__w Insertion in Front of Vowel Initial Suffix after k and m__ inserts w after k, m in front of plural -ak
Note that this rule probably is wrong, and that the -w- is
a morphological affix rather than a phonological variant.




__Suffix Final n __
