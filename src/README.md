How to use the alternative Makefile
===================================

Type this:

    make -j -f quick.mk

This will create _at least_ the following transducers (FSTs):

 - `crk-strict-analyzer.hfstol` ‚Äî reads Plains Cree wordforms and
   outputs analyses. Wordforms must be written in _perfect_ [SRO].
 - `crk-relaxed-analyzer.hfstol` ‚Äî reads Plains Cree wordforms, and
   outputs possible analyses. Wordforms can be written with known
   spelling variations, including long vowel relaxation. üòéüçπ
 - `crk-strict-generator.hfstol` ‚Äî given a morphological analyses,
   produces Plains Cree wordforms in SRO.
 - `crk-strict-generator-with-morpheme-boundaries.hfstol` same as
   above, but includes `<` and `>` to indicate morpheme boundaries

Want even _more_ FSTs? FSTs intended for use in _itw√™wina_, the online
Cree dictionary? You got 'em! Type this:

    make -j -f quick.mk dict

Which will create two additional FSTs:

 - `crk-strict-analyzer-for-dictionary.hfstol`
 - `crk-relaxed-analyzer-for-dictionary.hfstol`

These are the same as their counterparts, except they exclude some
analyses that are unnecessary in a dictionary application (namely,
_itw√™wina_).


Mini-glossary
-------------

### `crk`

The [ISO 639-3][] code for n√™hiyaw√™win, or Plains Cree.

[ISO 639-3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3

### analyzer

An FST that takes in a form in a language and attempts to produce one or
more likely linguistic analyses.

The inverse of a **generator**.

### generator

An FST that takes an analysis string from the language and attempts to
produce a valid linguistic form.

The inverse of an **analyzer**.

### for dictionary

(of an FST) intended for use with itw√™wina, or really any intelligent
dictionary for Plains Cree.

In practice, this means analyzers lack all `+Err/Frag` analyses and omit
the `+Err/Orth` tag, since these offer little value to the dictionary
(it's trying to match a lemma, after all!).

### morpheme boundary

A mark that denotes where one meaningful sub-unit of a word is separated
from a different, adjacent part of the same word.

In Plains Cree, these marks are `<` and `>`. `<` occurs before the stem
of a verbs and nouns and `>` is placed immediately after the noun or
verb stem.

For example,

Given `w√¢pam-` (stem of _w√¢pam√™w_ (VTA)):

 - <w√¢pam>√™w
 - ni<w√¢pam>√¢w
 - ki<w√¢pam>√¢w


Note that the _exact_ location of morpheme boundaries is sometimes unclear
due to morphophonological processes such as [sandhi]. Even in fuzzy
cases, the FST will produce a morpheme boundary mark.

### strict

Only produce or recognize text in a strict orthographical norm or
standard. In the case of Plains Cree, this means texts that adheres to
the [standard Roman orthography (SRO)][SRO].

Note: The itw√™wina database of dictionary heads is internally stored in
SRO, using circumflexes as the diacritic marker of vowel length.

Examples:

| Non-SRO    | SRO                      | Syllabics   |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| atchakosuk | ac√¢hkosak                | ·êä·ê¶·íê·ê¶·ëØ·ì¥·ê†     |
| neeyuh     | niya                     | ·ìÇ·î≠          |
| nagee      | nak√Æ                     | ·ìá·ëÆ          |
| ewapamat   | √™-w√¢pamat _or_ √™-w√¢pam√¢t | ·êÅ‚ÄØ·êö·ê∏·í™·êü      |

### relaxed

(of an **analyzer**) it can take in forms that do not conform to the
orthographical standard. We apply _spelling relaxation_ such that we can
accept multiple possible variant spellings of words, and will not
require adhering exactly to one normative spelling of a word.. The
spelling relaxation is done through a manually maintained list of rules.
