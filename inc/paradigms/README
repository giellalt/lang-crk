This is where we develop **paradigms** and **layouts** for itwêwina.

To generate the files suitable for usage for Neahttadigisánit/itwêwina, type:

    make

To check whether the paradigm and layout files have any problems, type:

    make check

To run ALL OF THE TESTS, type the following:

    make check-all

(Warning: this is slow.)

---

NOTE: When creating a new *.paradigm file, make sure to add a test case to
./paradigm-test-pairs.tsv. Add a new line with the name of the test case, then
a tab character, then a lemma that can be realized as each and every wordform
as listed in its respective paradigm file.
