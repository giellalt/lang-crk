This page documents the work on the **Plains Cree language model**. 

The analyser contains approximately 16500 stems — 2/3 of which are verbs —
the morphology and morphophonology for the grammar, as well
as a syntactic component.

The analyser is in use in an e-learning program, an e-dictionary
and a spellchecker.
